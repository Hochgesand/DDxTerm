A Quakestyle DropdownTerminal for Windows.
------

I wanted such a terminal for Windows so I made one.
It basically just hooks a window which you can select and moves it up and down, in this stage this is more just a proof of concept.

Btw: I used wxWidgets for the GUI, it's really good.

FYI https://wxwidgets.org/

There are no unittests to speak of, but I will implement them eventually.

For developers who want to contribute
---

If you want to compile it for yourself or you want to help me and contribute some code,
let me show you how to get your dev-setup up and running. It's pretty easy, grab a cofefe, this won't take long.

1. You'll need to compile wxWidgets first so that VisualStudio has all required DLLs to work with
  * Goto: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOIbK4bJKS8 
he explains pretty good how to setup wxWidgets, you only need to watch from 12:20M to 21:00M
    
2. When you're all setup just open the solution in the git root folder and it should just work.

If you have any questions just E-Mail me @ a@andrevr.de or open an issue.
